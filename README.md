# PRegionFill
Region fill algorithm (flood fill and boundary fill) implementation. There are 8 methods implemented, which are:
* flood fill recursive
* flood fill with stack
* flood fill scanline
* flood fill scanline with stack
* boundary fill recursive
* boundary fill with stack
* boundary fill scanline
* boundary fill scanline with stack

###Features
This work originally comes from programming assignment for Computer Graphics and Animation subject.
The following is the task which is given in the programming assignment which will also describe its main features.

Create an application that allows the user to do region fills. The application should be able to do the following:
* Draw a line/circle on the screen.
* Change colour.
* Clear screen.
* Save/load the contents of the screen to/from a file.
* Fill a region with a color (flood fill and boundary fill)
    * implement both methods: recursive and stack; pixel to pixel and scanline.
    * there are a total of 8 types of fills.
* Fill with checkered pattern. 
* Fill in with striped pattern.
* Show the order of pixels being filled.

###User Guide
Here is old user guide which was created bundled in programming assignment's report:
[PRegionFill/data/user_guide.pdf](https://github.com/alwayzmile/PRegionFill/blob/master/data/user_guide.pdf)

###Tech
* [Processing 2.2.1](https://processing.org/) - Right now doesn't run well in Processing 3.0
